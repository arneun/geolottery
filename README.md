# geolottery
Geolottery is an application which allows to bet on locations in Poland.
The player who managed to place his marker at the spot closest enough to the randomized location wins.

Users can choose from three radiuses, each at a different price point. The bigger the radius the bigger the chance of winning,  but also the price. 
Each user can place an unlimited amount of points, but prices and prizes should discourage covering the whole 313 893 kmÂ².
In addition to a webservice prototype there is a paired [prototype of mobile app](https://github.com/JanStoltman/HackYeah_Android) designed to make choosing the bet location and radius easily.
Winning chance varies from 1/100 000 to 1/10 000 but can be adapted by modifying betting circles.
